# effective-java-3

This project is using basic blocks to demo the functionality of Java programming. 
It uses quotes from Effective Java book of "Joshua Bloch" and some basic code samples from same book.
It has some additional good examples to lean the basic programming skills and some useful patterns which I have learnt during development.
